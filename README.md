COSC 1436 is an introductory course in computer science. It covers the fundamental concepts and principles of computer science, including programming, data structures, algorithms, and computer organization.

Students in this course will learn the fundamentals of computer programming using a low-level programming language such as C++. They will also learn about data structures, which are used to store and organize data in a computer, and algorithms, which are sets of instructions used to perform specific tasks. In addition, students will gain an understanding of computer organization, including how computers process and store data, and how they communicate with each other.

Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to apply what they have learned through hands-on programming projects and exercises. The course may also include lectures, discussions, and lab activities to reinforce key concepts and skills.

Overall, COSC 1436 is designed to provide a strong foundation in computer science for those interested in pursuing further studies in the field or in using computers to solve real-world problems.
